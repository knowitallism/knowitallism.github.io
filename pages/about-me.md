<p>I graduated from MIT in 2016 with a degree in literature. Since then I have become enamored with data science and the ability to tell stories and cull insights from data. Although I am new to the data science scene, I hope to provide useful content to fellow data science beginners. Please feel free to email me with any comments or questions that you may have as I develop this blog.</p>
