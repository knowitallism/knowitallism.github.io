    "<p>At its most basic form, a partial dependence plot is a graph showing your model's relationship to a single variable. How it does that exactly depends on whether you are using your random forest for classification or regression.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>For a regression model, the intuitive way to understand a partial dependence plot is a graph that shows us how our predicted value, $Y$, varies with a single free variable, $X$, when we average out the effects of all the other variables, $C$, in our model. How the partial dependence plot averages out the effects of the non-free variable is actually pretty cool, albeit, computationally intensive. First the algorithm will set X to a fixed value, then it will calculate $Y$ values at that fixed $X$ value, for every value of $C$ that appears in the training data. Those Y values are then averaged, and this process is repeated for every $X$ value that appears in the training data. I.e.</p>\n",

    "<p>Understanding how partial dependence plots work for classification models requires a little bit more understanding of how random forests work. For a quick recap, random forests operate by creating multiple tree models, and having each model vote on the outcome, with better performing models being allotted more votes. If you want a more through explanation on how random forests are built, I suggest you read <a href=\"http://blog.citizennet.com/blog/2012/11/10/random-forests-ensembles-and-performance-metrics\">this</a>.  A partial dependence plot in this case allows us to see the outcome of that vote for a single variable.</p>"

    "<p> At the end of the day, a random forest model isn't actually that different from a single regression tree. Sure, the composition is more complex, but a random forest is still tracing a decision path from the root to a final leaf, with each fork defined by a threshold value on an individual feature, and each fork changing the outcome of the parent node's initial guess (usually the trainset mean) by a specified amount. This path can be described the equation bellow:</p>\n",

But the inTrees library comes with built in tools that make it easy to prune the tree down to a practical list of if-then statements. Going back to the rules we extracted earlier, we can use the following bit of code to prune the list of rules to the best rules*, and present them as a table. Each row in the table gives us a rule, the number of decisions per rule, the rule's frequency in the forest, the prediction error of the rule, and the rule's prediction class.</p>"

    "<p> This is probably the most well-known way to understand random forests, but I figured I should include it here for the sake of thoroughness. As the name implies, the variable importance function produces sorts the variables in a random forest model by order of importance, where importance can either be defined by a variable's contribution to the mean squared error or the variable's effect on node impurity. In order to use this function, be sure to specify \"importance=true\" when building the random forest model, as demonstrated in the code bellow. </p>"
